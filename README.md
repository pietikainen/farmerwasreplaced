### Background and purpose

* Program and optimize a drone to automate a farm and watch it do the work for you. 
* Collect resources to unlock better technology and become the most efficient farmer in the world. 
* Improve your problem solving and coding skills.

Program a drone using a simple python-like language to fully automate various farming tasks that would otherwise be very grindy. Feel the satisfaction of simply pressing "execute" and watching your drone do all the hard work.

Farming earns you resources which can be spent to unlock new technology. Unlike most programming games the game isn't divided into distinct levels that you have to complete but features a continuous progression.

Programming is done in a simple language **similar to python**. The beginning of the game is designed to teach you all the basic programming concepts that you need and is very beginner friendly by unlocking and explaining them one by one.
If you already have programming experience you should be able to play through the early game very quickly and get to the more complex late game tasks that should still be a fun challenge even for experienced programmers.



### My project

My first goal was to have completed files to be able to run the game with some user intervention, for example switch the running functions when ever a distinct resource is needed.

This is now completed with the initial commit on 23/08/2024

#### Todo:

The following steps are to be completed:

* Refactor the code from the beginning and add better comments in-code
* Optimise drone movement to use as little operations as possible
* Optimise planting and harvesting of Sunflowers and Dinosaurs
* Experiment with different sorting algorithms for Cacti
* Link up existing functions to perform autonomously
* Implement a "god-function" that runs the whole game, incl. automated upgrades

* To GitHub: Workflow for releases in zip format
